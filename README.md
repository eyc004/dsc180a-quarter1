This is a repository for a Streamlit app that allows you to translate from English to Simplified Chinese. To get started, go to your terminal and pip install -r requirements.txt. Next, you need a Microsoft Azure AI account so you can put in your API key. Replace the place to inset your key in the app.py file. Lastly, you can run streamlit run app.py to launch the app!
