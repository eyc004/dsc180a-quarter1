# Political Sensitivity Guardrail
This is a repository for a Streamlit app that allows you to translate from English to Simplified Chinese. 

### How to use it on your local machine
1. Clone this GitHub repository
2. Go to your terminal and cd into that repository
3. Run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
4. Afterwards, in your terminal run "guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/sensitive_topics"

### Misc folder
There is a miscellaneous folder which contains the notebook I used to test Meta's Llama Guard. It is not a part of the app, but it is still worth including in case you want to see what I talked about in the report.
